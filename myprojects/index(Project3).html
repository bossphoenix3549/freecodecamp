                <p id="p1">HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
                    It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
                    such as JavaScript.</p>
                <p id="p2">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
                    documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
                    originally included cues for its appearance.

                <em>Here is a</em> <strong>Sample Code</strong> for you:</p>
                <code> &LeftAngleBracket;&excl;DOCTYPE html&RightAngleBracket;<br>
                 &LeftAngleBracket;html&RightAngleBracket;<br>
                 &LeftAngleBracket;body&RightAngleBracket;<br>
                 &LeftAngleBracket;p&RightAngleBracket; Hello WORLD<br>
                 &LeftAngleBracket;&sol;p&RightAngleBracket;<br>
                 &LeftAngleBracket;&sol;body&RightAngleBracket;<br>
                 &LeftAngleBracket;&sol;html&RightAngleBracket;</code><br>

                <header id="CSS" class="content_head">CSS</header>
                <p id="p3">CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
                    markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is
                    a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
                <p id="p4">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
                    colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility
                    and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
                    formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
                    repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load
                    speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. <br>
                    <em>Here is a</em> <strong>Sample Code</strong> for you:</p>
                <code>code {<br>

                    color: crimson;<br>
                    background-color: #f1f1f1;<br>
                    padding: 2px;<br>
                    font-size: 105%;<br>

                <header id="JS" class="content_head">JS</header>
                <p id="p5">JS is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
                    alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
                    behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated
                    JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
                <p id="p6">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the
                    ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                    functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                    styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
                    expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
                    <em>Here is a</em> <strong>Sample Code</strong> for you:</p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }

                <p id="p7">Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
                    emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.</p>
                <p id="p8">Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming
                    paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional
                    programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive
                    standard library.<br>

                <header id="MySQL" class="content_head">MySQL</header>
                <p id="p9">MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is
                    a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My, and "SQL", the
                    acronym for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data
                    tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a
                    language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as
                    control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like
                    MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage
                    system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and
                    creation of backups. </p>
                <p id="p10">MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
                    and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the
                    Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation). In 2010,
                    when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB. <br>
